# Lahman API
An open source REST API, written in Node/Express, serving historical baseball statistics, game logs, and more. The data is sourced from the 
[Lahman Baseball Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) and [Retrosheet](https://www.retrosheet.org/).

## About
The goal of this project is to create an accessible, easy to use API for sabermetricians, data scientists, baseball fans, and anyone else who wishes to interact
with the vast amount of [Open Data](https://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/) made available by the [Chadwick Baseball Bureau](http://chadwick-bureau.com/open-data/)
and [Sean Lahman](http://www.seanlahman.com/). It also serves as a portfolio project for me to display my skills as an API developer, and to learn more about Node.

You can read more about the application design and implementation details on my blog.
